## Summary
- We aim for a simple and clean site that contains everything about sushi. On the site you’ll be able to search our database of sushi’s and read about each sushi’s description and origin. If you sign up, you’ll be able to save your favorite sushi’s and post

## Things we want to have:

- Database of every sushi
- Types of sushi: https://www.tablespoon.com/posts/know-your-sushi-types-and-terms-before-ordering
- Menu example: https://www.toasttab.com/rbsushi-ranchobernardo/v3
- Login system that people can create/save accounts with
- Have users be able to upload their own sushis (picture, desc, reviews)[SQLAlchemy]
- Do this with database that will store sushi name, images, description, user reviews onto database (CB Big Idea #2 and #3)
- Have an option to view the descriptions and reviews of the sushi
- Pull from the database and display that information
- Library of all the tier lists other people have made that the user can browse
- Redirects to social media to draft messages

## Structure/Design:

* Function on flask
* Navbar that lets user navigate the website from info on sushi to posting their favorite sushis
* Data driven UI designs will be storyboarded through google drawings, then implemented into the website once approved. (CB Big Idea #3)
* Database holds information to
  * Sushi types, descriptions, and rating out of 10
  * Login information (this has to be dynamic)
  * Saved tier lists
  * Images to sushis submitted by the users (will include file size limiter, file type selector)
