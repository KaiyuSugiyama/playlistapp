## Our Idea Including Support for Individuals (Routes, Blueprints etc.)
- We aim for a simple and clean site that contains everything about kpop and music in general. On the site youâ€™ll be able to upload your favorite songs, and explore other people's musical interests.
- The site will contain blueprints and seperate routes that will directly lead to each of our individual work.
- Here is one such example:
