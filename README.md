  - the user (including user actions that trigger events)
  - a device
  - an online data stream
  - a file
- Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of
data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill
the program’s purpose
- At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose,
where you have defined:
  - the procedure’s name
  - the return type (if necessary)
  - one or more parameters
- An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the
body of the selected procedure
- Calls to your student-developed procedure
- Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and
program functionality

## Our Idea
- We aim for a simple and clean site that contains everything about sushi. On the site you’ll be able to upload images of sushi and review sushi and give your opinon on each sushi you eat.
